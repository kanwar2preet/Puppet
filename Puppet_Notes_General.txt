Core resource types in puppet : notify,file,package,service,exec,cron,user,group.

Manifest : Puppet programs are called file manifests and they use .pp extension.

Resource Declaration : it represents the desired state of one resource.

Before and require handle dependencies in the puppet. Before is used in earlier resource and lists resources that depend upon it.
Require is used in later resource and lists resources that depend upon it.

Notify and subscribe metaparameters make dependency relationships the way before and require do but they also make referesh relationships.
Not only will the earlier resource in the pair get synced first but if puppet make any changes to that resource, it will send a refresh 
event to later resource which will react accordingly.
