# Puppet Interview questions and general tips for puppet.


# Tip1 : If we are using a Trifecta of package, file and service and we remove package manually so next time when puppet apply is used 
# it will try to figure out best possible order to install package and restart the service but its not Always necessary that puppet will
# be right everytime so manual odering is defined in manifest.


# TIP2:  Puppet deals with different resource names in different OS e.g ntpd in centos and ntp in ubuntu by using selector.

# TIP3: In puppet variables begin with $sign

#TIP4: Selector expressions are like case statement but they resturn a value instead of executing a block code.
# One use for selector is to tell pupppet the OS kind and install the package accordingly e.g ntpd in centos and ntp in ubuntu.


#Selectors can be used wherever a value is expected. This includes:

# Variable assignments
# Resource attributes
# Function arguments
# Resource titles
# A value in another selector



#TIP5: $osfamily is a builtin puppet vaiable called fact which is basically a string that contains the name os the OS.
# ?{ begins the selector statement 

#TIP6 : removing resource declarations will not remove the resources from OS, we have to use attribute value pair for this.
