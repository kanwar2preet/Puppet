# Above manifest will help us to recover file using puppet
#
#Before puppet modifies a file puppet places the file in client file bucket.
#
# client file bucket is stored on the node
# To change a file to its old location we need to know the hash
# This can be located in /var/log/messges
# command is puppet filebucket -l --bucket /var/lib/puppet/clientbucket restore /puppet.txt hash_of_file_req
# -l paramenter tells that it is happening locally



# In case you just want to view the contents instead of restoring it:
# puppet filebucket -l --bucket /var/lib/puppet/clientbucket get /puppet.txt hash_of_file_req
